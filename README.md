##Cellular - [Game][link]
Cellular is a browser JavaScript game inspired by the popular agar.io. The purpose
of the game is to control your cell to eat those cells that are smaller than you,
avoiding the larger cells.

###AI Description

####Your Rival
The game begins with your rival slightly larger than you. The rival cell is programmed
to chase you when it is larger than you, or eat smaller cells until it IS larger
than you. There is a chance, though! You can eat your rival when you are larger,
gaining you a whopping 50 points.

####Enemy Cells
The enemy cells that are larger than you have nothing to worry about, so they wander
the space they're given. The smaller cells will try to avoid you if you get too close,
and the smaller they are, the more nimble, so be quick!

###Controls
Use your mouse to control your cell - your cell will follow your mouse position,
the farther away the mouse, the faster your cell will go!
